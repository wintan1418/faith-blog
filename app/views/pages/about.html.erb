    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Community was created with a simple but powerful purpose: to provide a safe, encouraging space 
      where believers can share their testimonies, struggles, victories, and spiritual insights with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that every faith journey is unique and valuable. Whether you're sharing a powerful testimony, 
      asking for prayer, seeking guidance, or simply reflecting on scripture, your voice matters here.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Believe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Community matters.</strong> We are stronger together than apart.</li>
      <li><strong>Every story has value.</strong> Your experience can encourage someone else.</li>
      <li><strong>Grace and love.</strong> We treat everyone with respect and compassion.</li>
      <li><strong>Growth is a journey.</strong> We're all works in progress, and that's okay.</li>
    </ul>
