    <h2>Our Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      Our community is built on love, respect, and the shared desire to grow in faith. 
      These guidelines help us maintain an environment where everyone feels safe to share openly.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>

    <h3>1. Love and Respect</h3>
    <p>
      Treat every member with love and respect, regardless of their background, denomination, or where they 
      are on their faith journey. We are here to build each other up, not tear down.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Authenticity with Wisdom</h3>
    <p>
      Share authentically, but use wisdom in what you share publicly. Personal details about others should 
      never be shared without their consent.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Encouragement First</h3>
    <p>
      When responding to others, lead with encouragement. Even when offering different perspectives, 
      do so with gentleness and respect.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>
      What's shared in our community should stay in our community. Don't share others' stories or 
      struggles outside of this platform without their explicit permission.
    </p>

    <h3>5. No Judgment</h3>
    <p>
      We're all at different places in our faith journey. What matters is that we're seeking growth 
      and connection. Leave judgment at the door.
    </p>
